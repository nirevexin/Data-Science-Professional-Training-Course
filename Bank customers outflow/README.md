# Bank customer outflow
## Status: completed

## Project goal: to train a ML model for identifying clients who may terminate the contract with the bank in order to be able to retain them in a timely manner.

## Work results:

- We trained several classifier models with a focus on identifying as many customers as possible who will actually churn;
- The model that gives the most accurate predictions is selected;
- It was possible to achieve a completeness rate of 61%: this means that practically 2 out of 3 clients selected by the model will actually be at risk;
