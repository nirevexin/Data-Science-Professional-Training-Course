# Oil field development
## Status: completed.

## Project goal: to choose from three regions one in which oil production will bring the greatest profit.

## Work results:

- Regression models were trained to predict oil reserves. Prediction accuracy varies across regions;
- The potential profit from the selection of wells based on the model solution was calculated;
- The risks of losses and confidence intervals for each region were calculated;
- Recommendations for choosing regions are given:
    - Region 2 is suitable if the company is not ready for increased risks (1% loss risk), but does not claim the best possible income;
    - Region 3 offers the greatest potential income, but the likelihood of losses is slightly higher (6.4% loss risk).
