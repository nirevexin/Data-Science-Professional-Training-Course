**Results:**
- We have tested three hypotheses and found:

  - The days of the week affect user activity differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
  - The first hypothesis was completely confirmed.

- Musical preferences do not change much during the week - be it Moscow or St. Petersburg. Small differences are noticeable at the beginning of the week, on Mondays:
  - in Moscow they listen to music of the world genre,
  - in St. Petersburg - jazz and classics.
Thus, the second hypothesis was only partially confirmed. This result might have been different if not for gaps in the data.

- The tastes of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg have more in common than differences. Contrary to expectations, genre preferences in St. Petersburg resemble those in Moscow.
- The third hypothesis was not confirmed. If differences in preferences exist, they are not noticeable for the majority of users.
