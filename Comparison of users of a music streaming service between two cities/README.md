## Project goal: Determining the musical preferences of users and the differences between the two cities by studying three hypothesis:
#### Hypotheses 1: User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
#### Hypotheses 2: on Monday morning some genres prevail in Moscow and others in St. Petersburg. Likewise, on Friday evenings, different genres predominate, depending on the city.
#### Hypothesis 3: St. Petersburg is the capital of rap, music of this genre is listened to more often there than in Moscow. And Moscow is a city of contrasts, in which, nevertheless, pop music prevails.
**Results:**
- We have tested the three hypotheses and found:

  - The days of the week affect user activity differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
  - The first hypothesis was completely confirmed.

- Musical preferences do not change much during the week - be it Moscow or St. Petersburg. Small differences are noticeable at the beginning of the week, on Mondays:
  - in Moscow, they listen to _music of the world_ genre,
  - in St. Petersburg - jazz and classics.
Thus, the second hypothesis was only partially confirmed. This result might have been different if not for gaps in the data.

- The tastes of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg have more in common than differences. Contrary to expectations, genre preferences in St. Petersburg resemble those in Moscow:
  - The third hypothesis was not confirmed. If differences in preferences exist, they are not noticeable for the majority of users.
