## Project goal: Conducting a study to create a neural network that will help determine the appropriate age of a person from photographs.
**Results:**
- A Neural Network model was created and trained, for which it is possible to obtain a metric value of at least MAE = 6.68 in the test sample, which is lower than the value required by the condition: 8.
- The Bread-Salt supermarket chain can use the resulting model as a computer system for processing customer photos.
- It is possible to improve the MAE by adding more epochs and trying different values for Adam.
