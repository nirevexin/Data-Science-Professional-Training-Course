# Analysis of the video game market for an online store
## Status: Completed.

## Project goal: to analyze the available data and determine which games sell best in order to launch an advertising campaign on them in 2017.

## Conclusions from the research:

- On average, gaming platforms are supported by developers for 4-5 years.
- Games that receive good reviews from critics tend to sell better.
- The most **potentially profitable platforms** are `PS4` and `XOne`. For some time, games for the `3DS`, `WiiU`, and `PSV` platforms will still be relevant. As for the `PC`, it has always been there, it doesnâ€™t sell as much as others, but it always remains.
- If we divide the **popularity of platforms by market**, then:
     - In **Japan**, they are true to their own: `Sony` and `Nintendo` platforms are the most popular.
     - In **Europe** and **North America**, everything is very similar, in contrast to the market share between `PS4` and `XOne`:
          - In **America**, they are almost equal, but in **Europe**, `PS4` dominates.
- From **genres**, it is recommended to choose games in the genre of `Action`, `Shooters` and `Sports` for **Europe** and **North America** and `Role-Playing` and `Action`for the **Japanese market**.
- **Age rating**:
     - In **Europe** and **North America**, the most sold ratings are `M`, `E` and `Unrated`.
     - In **Japan**: `Unrated` tops, with great superiority over others.
- **Critic ratings** have the same impact on game sales on all platforms.
- **User ratings** have no impact on sales on `PS3`, `PS4`, `X360` and `XOne`, but start to have some impact on `3DS` and `WiiU`, both from `Nintendo`.
- We also tested two hypotheses stated at the very beginning of the study. As a result:

     - **average user ratings** for `Xbox One` and `PC` have big probability to be **identical**.

     - **average user ratings** for the `Action` and `Sports` genres have big probability to be **different**.
