## Project: Protection of clients' personal data

* **Description**: 
It is necessary to protect the data of clients of an insurance company by developing a method for transforming data so that it is difficult to recover personal information from it.
* **Goal**: 
Development of a model for anonymization of personal data.
* **Stack**: 
`Python`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`
* **Activity Area**:
`Banking`, `Investments`, `Internet Services`, `Telecom`
* **Technical Area**:
`Machine Learning`, `Linear Algebra`
* **Data**:
  - The dataset contains the following features:
  - gender
  - age
  - salary of the insured
  - number of family members.
  - number of insurance payments to the client over the last 5 years.
### Results:
- We have found an encryption algorithm to encrypt customer data.

- We showed that, as we expected in theory, the quality of the model before and after encryption does not change in practice.
