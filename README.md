This repository contains data analytics and data science projects from different areas such as banking, industry, telecoms, real estate and online and offline business that I carried out during my studies.

- Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file, corresponding to a particular project.
- It also contains a README file with the results of the project.
- In case the project has a *sweetviz* report (an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with just two lines of code), there will also be an .html file with that report which you need to download and click-open in order to visualize.

Below is an overview of the projects:
